# Reflections from International Data Week 2016

*International Data Week in September 2016 brought together three events, SciDataCon, the International Data Forum, and the Research Data Alliance 8th  plenary. Joe Hand from the Dat team attended the conference. Check out [Joe's  notes](http://LINKME) from International Data Week too.*




## Metadata, Standardization, and Data Repositories

The amount of discussion, tooling, and concern around metadata and standardization was shocking.

### Preservation in the era of the Data Repository

The re3data registry has over 1500 data repositories registered. Each repository has its own revenue, sustainability, and preservation methodologies. 

Most repositories rely on single access point infrastructure such as HTTP or FTP for distributing data. An era of papers containing broken data links is imminent. Disappearing websites are a major issue for the web, one that the Internet Archive is trying to mitigate, but the same issue could prove fatal for scientific integrity.

(something about persistent identifiers?)

## The Long Tail of Data and the Reproducibility Crisis

Online distribution makes it much easier to share and discover the long tail. For example, Amazon made the long tail of books available -- only a few people may be interested in each book but there are many many of them. Overall, demand for items in long tail significantly exceeds the demand for the most popular items. There are two parallel ideas in research data. 

First, there is a long tail of data that researchers are interested in, similar to rare books on Amazon. These datasets may only have a few downloads but overall they have more demand than popular datasets, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondly, and more importantly, there is a long tail of researchers needing to publish data that may not fit within existing metadata, standards, or data repositories. In order to ensure reproducibility, it is essential to have a place for these researchers to publish and preserve their data. 

In the RDA session of the long tail interest group, several presenters made the point that much of the innovative work in research or around data will be happening in this long tail. Fields that are niche, types of data to unique to be standardized, and new uses of existing data, will not fit into old standards. If these types of research and data cannot be shared and archived, then reproducing much of published science will be impossible.

Unless you already know what data repository your data fits into (because its a specific domain, standard, etc.), publishing long tail data can be a challenge. Researchers have to decide on which, if any, general access repository fits their needs and the constraints of that use case. 

Unfortunately, publishing this type of data will only happen if researchers have a data publishing requirement or strong incentive, which is often missing in the long tail.

## Opportunities for Dat

Make useful data tools that researchers want to use regardless of if they want to share their data publicly.
